# Java Practice Problems
Simple Java codes for practice

<b>Door.java</b>

There are a certain number of doors in a hallway going from east to west. Each time you walk from east to west, you toggle certain doors (i.e., if the door is open, you close it, and vice versa). You do not change anything when you walk back from west to east.

The first time you walk from east to west, you toggle every single door. On the second turn, you toggle every second door (doors 2, 4, 6, etc.). On the third turn, you toggle every third door, and so on.

Problem: Write a program that decides what state a specific door is in (open or closed) depending on which turn you are taking. The program should take in the door number and turn number as command line arguments.

<b>Duplicate.java</b>

Problem: Write a program to print out only the duplicates in an array (of integers).

<b>Isomorph.java</b>

Isomorphic strings are strings that can be derived from each other by a set of character replacements (i.e., 'add' and bee' are isomorphic whereas 'day' and 'bee' are not).

Problem: Given two strings as input, write a program to determine if they are isomorphic.

<b>Knight.java</b>

Problem: Given the current (x, y) coordinate position of a knight piece within an 8 x 8 chessboard as an input, print out all possible coordinates that the knight can move to from that position.

<b>Palindrome.java</b>

Palindromes are strings that are the same when written forward or in reverse.

Problem: Determine if an input string is a palindrome.

<b>ReverseString.java</b>

Problem: Given a method of reversal (standard or inplace) and a string, reverse the string using that method. Standard reversal refers to storing the reversed string as a new string and returning it while in-place reversal refers to reversing the string without storing it into a new variable.
